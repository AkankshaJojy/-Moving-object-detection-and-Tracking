# Moving-object-detection-and-Tracking
The project focuses on developing algorithms and techniques for detecting and tracking moving objects in videos or real-time camera feeds. By analyzing consecutive frames and identifying changes in pixel intensity or motion patterns, the system can detect the presence of moving objects and track their trajectories over time.

# Process Flow
In this step the original image is being captured by the default camera and the image is being resized.The resized image is now converted from RGB to Gray scale image for easier processing. Gaussian blurring is applied, a technique  used in image processing for removing noise and detailings and finally within the rectangular frame the moving objects are being detected


# Applications
Surveillance Systems: Monitoring and detecting suspicious activities in security camera feeds.
Traffic Management: Analyzing vehicle movements and congestion patterns in traffic surveillance videos.
Robotics: Enabling robots to navigate dynamic environments and interact with moving objects.
Augmented Reality: Enhancing user experiences by overlaying virtual objects on real-world scenes.

Moving object detection and tracking play a vital role in various computer vision applications, contributing to advancements in surveillance, transportation, robotics, and augmented reality technologies.
