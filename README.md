# -Moving-object-detection-and-Tracking
The project focuses on developing algorithms and techniques for detecting and tracking moving objects in videos or real-time camera feeds. By analyzing consecutive frames and identifying changes in pixel intensity or motion patterns, the system can detect the presence of moving objects and track their trajectories over time.
